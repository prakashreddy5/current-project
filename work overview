In my new rolw I am working as a analyst and devops engineer.
my main task are doing the release, we use ready to go procedure(it means we release to prod when it is ready).
My main tools I am working on here are Azure devops, ansible, terraform, splunk, servicenow.
Azure devops: this is the cloud technology we are using now, we create a pipelines by using ansible scripts and deploy our code.
we create the infrastructure by using terraform.
splunk is used to monitor the logs.
servicenow is used to create the change requests to get approvals from managers.
In this repo i will give details of my work experiences.
